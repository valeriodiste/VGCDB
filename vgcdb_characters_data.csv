Ezio Auditore,Assassin's Creed,2009,Protagonist,Male,Brown,Brown,Gray,Red,"Ezio Auditore da Firenze (1459 – 1524) was a Florentine nobleman during the Renaissance, and, unbeknownst to most historians and philosophers, a Master Assassin and the Mentor of the Italian Brotherhood of Assassins, a title which he held from 1503 to 1513. He is also an ancestor of William and Desmond Miles, as well as Clay Kaczmarek.

A member of the House of Auditore, Ezio remained unaware of his Assassin heritage until the age of 17, when he witnessed the hanging of his father and two brothers, Federico and Petruccio. Forced to flee his birthplace with his remaining family members—his mother and sister—Ezio took refuge with his uncle in the Tuscan town of Monteriggioni, at the Villa Auditore.

After learning of his heritage from Mario, Ezio began his Assassin training and set about on his quest for vengeance against the Templar Order, and their Grand Master, the Spaniard Rodrigo Borgia, who had ordered the execution of his kin.

During his travels, Ezio managed to not only unite the pages of the Codex, written by Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, Mentor of the Levantine Brotherhood of Assassins, but also to save the cities of Florence, Venice, and Rome from Templar rule.

He ensured the future travels of Christopher Columbus to the New World, liberated Rome from Borgia rule, and prevented the rise to power of Ercole Massimo's Cult of Hermes, helping spread the Renaissance and Assassin ideals of independence and free will throughout Italy.

In the years that followed, Ezio began a quest to rediscover the lost history of the Order. Travelling to the aged fortress of Masyaf in order to learn more of the Assassins before him, he discovered it overrun with Templars and made his way to the city of Constantinople to uncover the location of the Masyaf keys which, as he discovered, would unlock the fortress's fabled hidden library when brought together.

A decade later, Ezio had retired and resided in a Tuscan villa with his wife, Sofia Sartor, and his two children; Flavia and Marcello. Sometime after helping teach the Chinese Assassin Shao Jun the ways of the Order, Ezio died of a heart attack at the age of 65, during a visit to Florence with his wife and daughter.

Edward Kenway,Assassin's Creed,2013,Protagonist,Male,Brown,Yellow,Gray,Red,"Edward James Kenway (1693 – 1735) was a Welsh-born British privateer-turned-pirate and a member of the West Indies and British Brotherhoods of Assassins.

Born to humble farmers, Edward always sought to acquire riches and fame. He became a privateer for the Royal Navy early in his life and, once accepted, found himself stationed in the West Indies. However, an abrupt end to the War of the Spanish Succession and the promise of gold, glory and fame eventually seduced him into a life of piracy. It was during this quest that Edward first encountered the Assassins and Templars, and became embroiled in their struggle.

Over the next few years, Edward struggled with the internal conflict that arose from his desire for fame and riches—through finding the Observatory—and his duty to his friends. After losing nearly all of his closest friends, he realized the folly of his quest for glory. He then joined the Assassin Order, hunted down the Templars in the region and entrusted the Observatory to the Assassins.

After a decade in the West Indies, Edward returned to Britain and received a pardon from Robert Walpole. He soon acquired an estate in London and married Tessa Stephenson-Oakley, with whom he fathered a son named Haytham. He quickly joined the British Assassins, rising up to the rank of Master Assassin, and eventually, leader. Continuing his work as an Assassin, Edward researched the First Civilization, and kept the research in a journal. In 1735, he was killed by mercenaries in the employ of the Templar Grand Master Reginald Birch, in order to acquire the journal. Haytham would later father Ratonhnhaké:ton; through this line, Edward is an ancestor of William Miles, and his son, Desmond.

In 2013, Abstergo Entertainment tasked a research analyst exploring Edward's genetic memories in order to gather footage for a planned video game, Pirates of Nightmares. Three years later, Abstergo Entertainment uses the resources to make a downloadable content for Identity Project.

Evie Frye,Assassin's Creed,2015,Protagonist,Female,Blue,Brown,Dark Gray,Red,"Dame Evie Frye (born 1847) was a Master Assassin of the British Brotherhood, active in London during the Victorian era, and the elder twin sister of Jacob Frye. She was also a member of the Order of the Sacred Garter, and the grand-aunt of Lydia Frye.

Originating from Crawley, Evie and her brother traveled to London to liberate London from the Templars' control and help the poverty-stricken masses, following the death of their father by natural causes. To accomplish this, she and Jacob founded the Rooks, a criminal syndicate that opposed the Templar-backed Blighters.

While Jacob focused on eliminating targets instrumental to Grand Master Crawford Starrick's operations, Evie pursued the Shroud of Eden, a First Civilization artifact hidden within the city. In doing so, she regularly came into conflict with Lucy Thorne, Starrick's second-in-command and an expert on the Pieces of Eden.

Altair Ibn-LaAhad,Assassin's Creed,2007,Protagonist,Male,Brown,Black,Gray,Red,"Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad (1165 – 1257) was a member of the Levantine Brotherhood of Assassins who served as their Mentor from 1191 until his death in 1257. During his tenure as Mentor, through the knowledge of an Apple of Eden, Altaïr made several discoveries and inventions that greatly helped the Order's progression. His leadership saw to the spread of the Assassins' influence throughout the Old World.

Raised to be an Assassin from birth, Altaïr became a Master Assassin at age 25, an accomplishment unheard of for one so young.He failed to recover an Apple of Eden from Robert de Sablé in July 1191 and subsequently allowed the Templars to attack the town of Masyaf, headquarters of the Assassins. For this, he was demoted to the rank of novice and sent on a quest for redemption.

Tasked with the deaths of nine individuals who, unbeknownst to him, made up the ranks of the Templar Order in the Holy Land, Altaïr began a quest to change his ways and liberate the Kingdom from their corruption. During his quest, however, Altaïr learned of a plot far more sinister than he originally believed. In completing his mission, he also cleansed the Order of its treacherous leader Al Mualim. Altaïr thereafter became Mentor, taking the Assassins in a new, more secretive direction.

With the Apple in hand, Altaïr changed the way members of his Order lived their lives, writing the details in his fabled Codex for later generations of the Order to read. Altaïr's vision of the Assassin Order was for them to be spread across the world, living among the people, and he began establishing many Assassins Guilds during his tenure as Mentor. Throughout his travels, Altaïr strengthened his Order, stopping various Templar plots over the years as well as halting the inexorable march of Genghis Khan. Altaïr is an ancestor to Desmond Miles, through the maternal line.",assassins_creed_altair_ibnlaahad.png,banner_assassins_creed.png,altair ibnlaahad,assassins creed

From 1476, he served as Grand Master of the Roman Rite of the Templar Order.

Originally hailing from Spain, Rodrigo moved to Italy where he studied and joined the Catholic Church, eventually becoming a cardinal. Using the influence he gained from his clerical position, Rodrigo conspired several plots to murder political leaders across the country to claim it under the Templar banner. As one of the wealthiest men in Europe, Rodrigo's power as Grand Master spread all over the continent.

In 1488, Rodrigo was responsible for shipping an Apple of Eden from Cyprus to Venice, before it was stolen by his arch-enemy, Ezio Auditore da Firenze and his fellow Italian Assassins. In 1492, via several bribes and power plays, Rodrigo won the Papal conclave, and became one of the most controversial Renaissance popes.

Under the leadership of the House of Borgia, the Templars focused primarily on establishing their power and control in Europe, losing sight of their true ideology. The Templars commonly refer to this era as the ""Dark Age of the Order"".",assassins_creed_rodrigo_borgia.png,banner_assassins_creed.png,rodrigo borgia,assassins creed
Crash Bandicoot,Crash,1996,Protagonist,Male,Green,None / Undefined,Orange,Blue,"Crash Bandicoot is the title character and main protagonist of the Crash Bandicoot series. Introduced in the 1996 video game Crash Bandicoot, Crash is a mutant eastern barred bandicoot who was genetically enhanced by the series' main antagonist Doctor Neo Cortex and soon escaped from Cortex's castle after a failed experiment in the ""Cortex Vortex"". Throughout the series, Crash acts as the opposition against Cortex and his schemes for world domination. While Crash has a number of offensive maneuvers at his disposal, his most distinctive technique is one in which he spins like a tornado at high speeds and knocks away almost anything that he strikes. Crash was created by Andy Gavin and Jason Rubin, and was originally designed by Charles Zembillas. Crash was intended to be a mascot character for Sony to use to compete against Nintendo's Mario and Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog. Before Crash was given his name (which stems from the visceral reaction to the character's destruction of boxes), he was referred to as ""Willie the Wombat"" for much of the duration of the first game's production. Crash has drawn comparisons to mascots such as Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog by reviewers. His animations have been praised, while his voice has faced criticism. He has been redesigned several times throughout many games, which have drawn mixed reactions.",crash_crash_bandicoot.png,banner_crash.png,crash bandicoot,crash
Neo Cortex,Crash,1996,Antagonist,Male,Red,Black,Yellow,Light Gray,"Doctor Neo Cortex is a fictional character and the main antagonist of the Crash Bandicoot video game series. He has appeared in every mainline game in the series as Crash Bandicoot's archenemy, as well as a playable character in several spin-off titles. Cortex is an egomaniacal mad scientist who seeks to achieve world domination with the use of the Evolvo-Ray, a machine capable of creating genetically enhanced soldiers from ordinary animals. Crash was one such subject but thwarted the scientist's plot; Cortex is subsequently determined to eliminate Crash as an obstacle to world domination. Cortex was created by Naughty Dog founders Andy Gavin and Jason Rubin, and was originally designed by Charles Zembillas. Voice actors who have portrayed Cortex include Brendan O'Brien, Clancy Brown and Lex Lang. Cortex has been positively received by reviewers, with much of the praise going to Brown's and Lang's vocal performances as well as the character's portrayal in Crash Twinsanity.",crash_neo_cortex.png,banner_crash.png,neo cortex,crash
Nitrus Brio,Crash,1996,Enemy,Male,Brown,None / Undefined,Green,Light Gray,"Dr. Nitrus Brio (a.k.a. N. Brio) is a scientist who formerly worked under Neo Cortex. Brio's loyalty has fluctuated throughout the series, working on his own accord in Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back, with Nefarious Tropy in Crash Twinsanity, and even returning to Cortex's side in Crash Bash, Crash: Mind Over Mutant and Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. His name was a play on the word ""embryo"" (a fact that he himself alludes to in Mind Over Mutant).",crash_nitrus_brio.png,banner_crash.png,nitrus brio,crash
Aku Aku,Crash,1996,Neutral,Male,Yellow,None / Undefined,Brown,Yellow,"Aku Aku is the guardian of the Wumpa Islands and the father figure of Crash and his friends. Aku Aku is the spirit of an ancient witch doctor encased in a floating, wooden mask. During Crash's missions to stop Doctor Neo Cortex, he scattered copies of himself throughout the travels in an effort to aid him in his mission. Whenever Crash possesses an Aku Aku mask, he will be shielded from one enemy attack or contact. Collecting three Aku Aku masks gives Crash temporary invulnerability from all minor dangers. Producer David Siller provided his ""Ooga Booga"" and gibberish voice clips. His speaking voice was provided by Mel Winkler from Crash Bandicoot: Warped to Crash Twinsanity, by Cornell John in Crash Bash, and Greg Eagles from Crash of the Titans onwards. Aku Aku was named after a Polynesian restaurant near the Alewife station that featured giant tiki statues out front. Steven Rodriguez of Nintendo World Report, in his review of Crash Nitro Kart, described Aku Aku's voice when giving advice between races as ""sexy"" and cited it as the best part of the game's audio, but admitted that ""even he gets rather annoying."" In his review of Crash of the Titans, Brian Rowe of GameRevolution, while deeming the ability to ""slap Aku Aku’s face into the ground and ride it like a surfboard"" as ""harshly inconsiderate"", considered it ""payback for his gratingly poor impersonations of that other floating head of wisdom – Frylock."" Lucas Sullivan of GamesRadar+, in a dedicated installment of the ""Why I Love"" series, compared Aku Aku's charm to that of Mumbo Jumbo of Banjo-Kazooie, adding that his vocalizations and protective hovering within Crash's vicinity exuded more personality than the power-ups in the Mario series. He also enjoyed Aku Aku's speaking role in the series' later installments, describing his voice as having a ""vaguely Morgan Freeman-esque timbre"". The staff of GameRevolution included Aku Aku in a list of the best power-ups in video games, describing him as an ""all-around swell guy"".",crash_aku_aku.png,banner_crash.png,aku aku,crash
Coco Bandicoot,Crash,1997,Secondary,Female,Green,Yellow,Brown,Blue,"Coco Bandicoot is Crash's spirited and highly intelligent younger sister. By nature, she is a tinkerer and problem solver, possessing an innate inquisitiveness and fanciful imagination. She is frequently equipped with a laptop or tablet computer, which is filled with schematics, works in progress, and personal notes. Unlike Crash, she possesses a healthy skepticism of others and their motivations. She seeks to get Crash's relaxed lifestyle more organized, and while she is content to allow Crash to make his own mistakes and derive amusement from the results, she is prepared to intervene when Crash finds himself in legitimate danger. Coco first appeared in Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back, in which she uses her hacking skills to sporadically appear via hologram and warn Crash of Cortex's intentions. She appears as a playable character in select levels of Crash Bandicoot: Warped and Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex. She is twice incapacitated in her minor appearance in Crash Twinsanity, and is kidnapped and brainwashed into aiding Nina Cortex's plot in Crash of the Titans; in the Nintendo DS version of the latter game, she appears as a vendor selling upgrades for Crash's abilities. In the Wii and Xbox 360 versions of Crash: Mind over Mutant, Coco becomes a playable character in the two-player mode after being freed from the influence of the NV device. She is a selectable player character for the entirety of Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, and is the subject of a number of unlockable ""Flashback Tape"" levels, which take place during the course of the first game. The tapes reveal that Coco was created by Cortex a month after Crash's escape from his castle, and was Cortex's last bandicoot before he would consider replacement animals. Coco's signature overalls were a hand me down originally crafted by Doctor N. Brio's mother and donated by Cortex without Brio's consent. During her training, Coco displayed a fascination with technology (as well as a video game addiction), which Doctor N. Gin took as an opportunity to mentor her in mechanics and computing. Coco ultimately escaped Cortex's castle under the guise of undertaking another trial. Coco is a playable character in the racing games Crash Team Racing, Crash Nitro Kart, and Crash Tag Team Racing, as well as the party titles Crash Bash and Crash Boom Bang!. Following a minor appearance in Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure, she appears as a brainwashed boss character in Crash Bandicoot 2: N-Tranced, in which she is subsequently a playable character in select levels. In Crash Bandicoot Purple: Ripto's Rampage, she teams up with the Professor of the Spyro series to track down Cortex and Ripto. After being freed from Nina Cortex's capture, the pair are able to trace the villains to their hideout with Crash's and Spyro's assistance. Coco was designed by Charles Zembillas and Naughty Dog as a counterbalance to Tawna (Crash's girlfriend in the first game) that would appease Sony Computer Entertainment Japan, who were not comfortable with a ""super sexy"" character being alongside Crash. Charles Zembillas' first sketches of Coco were drawn on March 18, 1997. She is voiced by Vicki Winters in Cortex Strikes Back, Hynden Walch in Crash Team Racing, Debi Derryberry from Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex to Crash Bandicoot: On the Run!, Tara Strong in the third season of Skylanders Academy, and by Eden Riegel in Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time.",crash_coco_bandicoot.png,banner_crash.png,coco bandicoot,crash
Cloud Strife,Final Fantasy,1997,Protagonist,Male,Blue,Yellow,Yellow,Gray,"Cloud Strife is the protagonist of Final Fantasy VII, Final Fantasy VII Remake, and Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. He also appears in the spin-off games of the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII as a supporting character, including Dirge of Cerberus -Final Fantasy VII- and Crisis Core -Final Fantasy VII-.

An arrogant and proud swordsman at first, Cloud introduces himself to Avalanche as a former member of an elite warrior unit called SOLDIER who has turned mercenary, and uninterested in anything beyond his hired task at hand. Beneath his hardened outer persona is a softer, more caring individual who simply struggles to open up, but is striving to be a hero. Cloud later discovers more about his past and, with the help of his friends, learns there is more to being a hero than possessing physical strength and fame. He develops compassion for the planet and the people he fights to protect from the Shinra Electric Power Company and his nemesis, Sephiroth.

Cloud Strife wields large broadswords in battle, including the iconic Buster Sword, and is a versatile melee combatant. In Final Fantasy VII, he has access to the most powerful weapons in the game, as well as the strongest Limit abilities (all of which involve his sword), though they take the longest to learn. In Final Fantasy VII Remake, Cloud's strength is in his raw damage output and his versatility, able to switch back-and-forth between the agile Operator Mode and the more offensive Punisher Mode that allows him to counterattack. In both titles, Cloud has the best all-around stats.

Sephiroth,Final Fantasy,1997,Antagonist,Male,Blue,White,Gray,Gray,"Sephiroth is the main antagonist of Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VII Remake and one of the primary antagonists in its extended universe. In spin-off appearances, Sephiroth is depicted as Cloud Strife's archenemy and is seen as a symbol of Cloud's troubled past haunting him. Sephiroth is a former renowned SOLDIER who became twisted.

Before his fall from grace, Sephiroth was one of the most lauded success stories of the Shinra Electric Power Company's SOLDIER program. His successes in the field of battle during the conflicts surrounding Shinra's bid for global domination led to his status as a celebrity war hero and the poster boy for both the Shinra Military and the company's SOLDIER program. Learning of his true origins made him insane, causing him to be driven by a desire to destroy the world.

Sephiroth is briefly a party member during a flashback in the original Final Fantasy VII, and is both the penultimate and final boss.

Tifa Lockhart,Final Fantasy,1997,Secondary,Female,Red,Black,Dark Gray,Light Gray,"Tifa Lockhart is a playable character in Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VII Remake. She is the main protagonist of the novel Final Fantasy VII Remake Trace of Two Pasts, and also plays a supportive role in Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, Dirge of Cerberus -Final Fantasy VII-, and Crisis Core -Final Fantasy VII-. She is a friend of Cloud Strife, and a member of the resistance group Avalanche.

Tifa grew up with Cloud in Nibelheim, but lost contact with him years ago. When she meets him again, she convinces him to join Avalanche to fight the Shinra Electric Power Company, whom she bears hatred for due to the destruction of their hometown. She supports Cloud as his comrade and helps him and his allies fight Sephiroth. Tifa is reserved and empathic, acting as a motherly figure towards her allies when providing encouragement and emotional support. She also serves as the voice of reason grounding them to think things through and do the right thing.

In contrast to her shy personality, Tifa has a vigorous combat style, fighting with her fists. Trained by Zangan, she uses martial arts skills to fight opponents up close, and equips knuckles as her weapons. In the original Final Fantasy VII, unlike other characters, her Limit abilities, each a different martial arts technique, are not selected from a list, rather, each ability can be used consecutively if the slots land on the ""Yeah!"" reel for the ability. Tifa has a similar role in Final Fantasy VII Remake as an agile close combat fighter making use of powerful techniques in battle, with a unique ability based on her Unbridled Strength chi level.

Aerith Gainsborough,Final Fantasy,1997,Secondary,Female,Green,Brown,Red,Light Gray,"Aerith Gainsborough, alternately known with the first name Aeris, is a playable character in Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VII Remake. She is one of the lead protagonists of the novel Final Fantasy VII Remake Trace of Two Pasts, and a major character in the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII, appearing in Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, Crisis Core -Final Fantasy VII- and Before Crisis -Final Fantasy VII-.

Aerith is the last of the Cetra, an ancient race with powerful magical abilities, and so the Shinra Electric Power Company hunts her throughout her life, seeking to exploit her powers. She meets Cloud Strife in Midgar, and the two become close, leading her to join his quest to fight Shinra and hunt down Sephiroth. Aerith is upbeat, carefree, and joyful, being flirtatious towards Cloud and compassionate towards others.

Aerith wields staves in battle, and is in the back row by default, as she primarily uses magic from equipped Materia in battle. Her Limit abilities are defensive, either providing restorative powers, healing other party members, or bestowing status enhancements.

Barret fights passionately for his cause to protect the planet. He cares greatly for his allies, motivating them with powerful speeches, while also himself fighting on the front lines of his cell's operations. His seemingly benevolent cause of fighting for the planet is a cover for his personal vendetta and anger, which he later must come to terms with. Despite his brash and sometimes violent attitude, Barret has a good heart, and is torn between fighting and caring for his daughter, Marlene.

Barret wields a gun-arm, a mechanical gun grafted in place of his right arm, allowing him to fire from range. His Limit Break abilities largely consist of physical attacks with these weapons. Barret has high HP, allowing him to fill the role of taking damage from other party members.

Kratos,God of War,2005,Protagonist,Male,Orange,None / Undefined,Gray,Red,"Kratos is the protagonist of the God of War series. The character is a power-hungry Spartan who, to save his life, was eventually forced to serve the Olympian god Ares. During one murderous rampage, Kratos accidentally killed his wife and child. Kratos renounced Ares, became a tormented soul (including imprisonment by the Furies), and served the gods for ten years in hopes of becoming free of the nightmares. He eventually killed Ares and became the God of War, but was betrayed by his father, Zeus. A series of attempts to free himself from the influence of the gods and Titans followed, culminating in a final confrontation with Zeus, ending in the god's death and the reign of the Olympian Gods. In the aftermath, Athena appeared and Kratos sacrificed himself to prevent her from becoming the supreme goddess of the world. Many years later, surviving his fatal sacrifice, Kratos now lives in the world of the Norse gods in Midgard where he now has a son named Atreus. Following the death of his second wife Faye, he and Atreus journey to the highest peak of the nine realms to fulfill her promise and spread her ashes there. Along their journey, Kratos eventually reveals that he is a god to Atreus, and after defeating Baldur and in turn becoming an enemy of the Norse gods, he finally reveals his troubled past to his son and that they should learn from past mistakes.

The character was originally voiced by Terrence C. Carson; his final portrayal of the character was in 2013's Ascension. Christopher Judge replaced TC Carson in 2018's God of War. Antony Del Rio voiced the character as a child in Ghost of Sparta (2010).

Athena,God of War,2005,Secondary,Female,Blue,Brown,Yellow,Light Gray,"Athena was the Goddess of Wisdom and Kratos' mentor and ally throughout the Greek era in the series. In Chains of Olympus, Athena initially tasked Kratos to find Helios as in the absence of light, the god Morpheus had caused many of the gods to fall into a deep slumber. In God of War (2005), she gave Kratos the mission of killing Ares, as Zeus had forbidden divine involvement, and was instrumental in allowing Kratos to become the new God of War. Although she begged Kratos to stop his second quest for the Ambrosia of Asclepius in the comic series (2010–11) and lied to him about his brother Deimos in Ghost of Sparta, Athena was still sympathetic towards Kratos even after he renounced the gods and was betrayed by Zeus in God of War II. Athena died trying to protect Zeus from Kratos, and was resurrected and elevated to a new level of understanding in God of War III. With ulterior motives, Athena became Kratos' ally once more and guided him to the Flame of Olympus surrounding Pandora's Box, which allowed Kratos to kill Zeus and end the reign of Mount Olympus, once Kratos defeated and killed nearly all the gods, Athena appeared to him and told him he has the power of hope, and demanded that he should give her the power so she could rule humanity as its sole goddess, though Kratos foils this attempt by stabbing himself to release it instead to the whole world, leaving Athena enraged and disappointed at him, leaving the latter to seemingly die. Her spirit later returns to Kratos in God of War (2018) to haunt and taunt him about his past that he had kept secret from his son Atreus. As he was retrieving his old weapons, the Blades of Chaos, she said he was nothing more than a monster, to which Kratos replied that he was not her monster anymore.

The character was voiced by Carole Ruggier in 2005's God of War, 2007's God of War II, and 2018's God of War. Erin Torpey voiced the character in Chains of Olympus (2008), God of War III (2010), and Ghost of Sparta (2010).

Gaia,God of War,2005,Neutral,Female,None / Undefined,None / Undefined,Brown,Green,"Gaia was the mother of the Titans and embodiment of Earth. At the request of Zeus' mother Rhea, Gaia raised and protected the young Zeus to prevent Cronos from devouring him, as he had devoured his other children. When Zeus grew to manhood, he betrayed Gaia, freed his siblings, and Gaia was banished with her fellow Titans at the conclusion of the Great War. In God of War II, she saved Kratos from the Underworld after a disastrous encounter with Zeus, and directed the Spartan to find the Sisters of Fate in order to take revenge on Zeus. A successful Kratos plucked Gaia and the Titans from the moment in time before their defeat in the Great War to launch an abortive attack on Olympus. In God of War III, Gaia was wounded in the assault on Olympus and abandoned Kratos, stating he was a pawn of the Titans so that they could have their revenge. Kratos eventually found and crippled Gaia, but she returned and interrupted the final battle between the Spartan and Zeus. The pair entered Gaia's neck wound, and with the Blade of Olympus, Kratos destroyed her heart, killing the Titan.

The character was voiced by Linda Hunt in God of War II, and Susan Blakeslee in God of War III. Gaia was also the narrator during cut scenes in God of War, again voiced by Hunt.

Zeus,God of War,2005,Antagonist,Male,Blue,White,Gray,Light Gray,"Zeus was the King of the Olympian Gods and the main antagonist of God of War II and God of War III. Zeus and Ares believed the destruction of Olympus would come at the hands of Kratos' brother Deimos, so they had Deimos imprisoned and tortured by Thanatos. Many years later, in God of War (2005), Zeus aided Kratos against Ares by bestowing him with the magic, ""Zeus' Fury"", and as the mysterious gravedigger. In God of War: Ghost of Sparta, Zeus realizes Kratos was the prophesied Marked Warrior, not Deimos. In God of War II, it is revealed that Zeus had become infected with fear. He tricked Kratos into draining his godly powers into the Blade of Olympus, stating it was required to deal with the new threat actually created by Zeus. Kratos, stripped of his power, was mortally wounded while human, and killed by Zeus. With the help of the Titan Gaia, Kratos used the power of the Sisters of Fate to return to the moment Zeus betrayed him and defeated Zeus after extensive combat. Zeus was saved by Athena, who sacrificed herself to preserve Olympus. Before dying, Athena revealed that Kratos is Zeus' son, and that Zeus feared a perpetuation of the son-killing-father cycle, as Zeus imprisoned his father Cronos. This was confirmed in God of War III when Kratos discovered that Zeus was infected with fear when Kratos first opened Pandora's Box and used its power to kill Ares. After a lengthy battle and an enlightening encounter with Pandora in his psyche, Kratos finally overcame and killed Zeus. Later in God of War (2018), Zeus appears as a haunting vision to Kratos while in Helheim.

The character was originally voiced by Paul Eiding in 2005's God of War. Corey Burton, who had previously voiced Zeus in the animated Disney show based on the film Hercules, took over the role in God of War II. He continued it in God of War III, in the multiplayer mode of Ascension, where Zeus appears as one of the four gods that players can pledge their allegiance to, and in 2018's God of War. Fred Tatasciore provided Zeus's voice in Ghost of Spartas after-game ""Combat Arena"" mode.

Atreus,God of War,2005,Protagonist,Male,Blue,Red,Gray,Yellow,"Atreus is a secondary protagonist introduced in the Norse era of the series. He is the young son that Kratos bore with the giant named Faye and has the ability to telepathically hear the thoughts of other beings. His mother taught him archery and how to read runes. His first adventure into the wilderness in A Call from the Wilds brought him to an encounter with some draugr, and he had to be saved by his father Kratos, after which, the two battled a revenant. Following Faye's death of an unknown cause in God of War (2018), Atreus journeys with his father Kratos to fulfill his promise to spread her ashes at the highest peak of the nine realms. Atreus did not know about Kratos' past or that he was a god. After Atreus falls ill due to a mental contradiction of a god thinking himself mortal, Kratos goes to Helheim to retrieve an item to heal him. After Atreus is cured, Kratos reveals that he is a god, but says nothing about his past. Knowing he is a god and thinking he can do anything, Atreus becomes arrogant and murders Modi, despite Kratos ordering not to. The two eventually make amends and team up to face Baldur. After Baldur's defeat, Kratos reveals his past and tells Atreus that they should learn from the mistakes of their predecessors. The two then go to Jötunheim to complete their journey. There, they learn that Faye was a giant, making Atreus part-giant, part-god, and part-mortal due to Kratos being a demigod formerly before becoming a god after killing Ares. It was also revealed that his mother had originally named him Loki, but Kratos chose Atreus, a name of an honorable Spartan comrade of his. The two then spread her ashes at Jötunheim's peak before going home. Atreus then has a vision that years later, at the end of Fimbulwinter, Thor will come for them. He is voiced by Sunny Suljic.

Master Chief,Halo,2001,Protagonist,Male,None / Undefined,None / Undefined,Green,Gray,"Master Chief Petty Officer John-117, commonly referred to as simply the Master Chief, is the main protagonist and main playable character in many of the Halo games. The character is voiced by Steve Downes, a Chicago disc jockey. He is one of the Spartans, an elite group of augmented soldiers raised from childhood to be super soldiers. Assisted by the artificial intelligence Cortana, he prevents the catastrophic firing of Installation 04 in Halo: Combat Evolved. Developing the character of Master Chief was part of Bungie's efforts to make players invested in playing the game. The character has since become a gaming icon, the mascot of the Xbox, and rated as one of the greatest characters in video games. In live action, the Chief has been portrayed by Daniel Cudmore in Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn and Pablo Schreiber in the Paramount+ series.

Cortana,Halo,2001,Secondary,Female,Blue,Blue,Blue,Sky Blue,"Cortana, voiced in the games by Jen Taylor, is the artificial intelligence (AI) who assists the Master Chief in the video games. She is one of many ""smart"" AIs, and is based on the brain of Dr. Catherine Halsey; the nature of her construction means she is subject to a finite lifespan. In Halo 4, Cortana begins to succumb to her age, and sacrifices herself to save Chief and Earth from the Forerunner Didact, but Halo 5: Guardians reveals that she had survived the ordeal. Having found access to the Domain, a Forerunner repository of knowledge, Cortana believes that AIs should serve as the galaxy's caretakers, putting her in conflict with her creators. In Halo Infinite, however, after Atriox seemingly defeats Chief which devastates her, Cortana finally destroys herself. Cortana has been called one of gaming's greatest characters, and one of the ""50 Greatest Female Characters"" and the heart of the franchise. The character's sex appeal has also been a focus on commentary.",halo_cortana.png,banner_halo.png,cortana,halo
Gravemind ,Halo,2007,Antagonist,Other,None / Undefined,None / Undefined,Gray,Green,"Gravemind (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) is one of the primary antagonists in the Halo series. The Gravemind is a large, sentient creature of Flood origin, created by the parasite to serve as its central intelligence once a critical biomass has been achieved. It was introduced during the events of Halo 2, where the creature saves both the Master Chief and Arbiter from their deaths, bringing the two face to face in the bowels of Delta Halo. Gravemind reveals to the Arbiter that the ""sacred rings"" are actually weapons of last resort; a fact the Master Chief confirms. In order to stop Halo from being fired, Gravemind teleports the Master Chief and Arbiter to separate locations, but also uses them as a distraction; Gravemind infests the human ship In Amber Clad, and uses it to invade the Covenant city of High Charity. Capturing Cortana, Gravemind brings High Charity to the Ark in an effort to stop the High Prophet of Truth from activating the Halo network. Although the Master Chief destroys High Charity, Gravemind survives the blast and attempts to rebuild itself on the incomplete Halo. When Halo is activated, Gravemind accepts his fate, but insists that the activation of the ring will only slow, not stop, the Flood. In Halo Wars 2: Awakening the Nightmare, the Gravemind's warning is validated when the Banished inadvertently release a number of surviving Flood forms from High Charity's wreckage. It is also mentioned in the game's menu that while the Gravemind's ""most recent physical avatar"" was destroyed by the Master Chief, it is ""only a matter of time before it rises again"". Though the Flood released upon the Ark form a Proto-Gravemind and come close to forming a new Gravemind, the Proto-Gravemind is killed by the Banished and the Flood are once again contained by the Banished and the Ark's Sentinels.

Designed to be a massive, horrifying combination of tentacles and rotting matter, reception to the character was generally mixed. Mike Leonard of the AllXbox community said that the introduction of the ""Little Shop of Horrors"" reject ""ruined the 'cool'"" of the Halo franchise. Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com complained that the link between Gravemind and the Flood was never explicitly stated in either Halo 2 or Halo 3 and was hardly seen in the last game.",halo_gravemind_.png,banner_halo.png,gravemind ,halo

He comes in contact with Snake in the game while posing as a hostage, but attacks him after the truth is revealed. His name is mentioned in Metal Gear Solid 4 as the scientist who saved Raiden's life after being turned into a cyborg. A character with the same name also plays a supporting role in Hideo Kojima's adventure game Snatcher, although the English-language version for the Sega CD spells his name as Dr. Petrovich Modnar.

Big Boss,Metal Gear,1987,Antagonist,Male,Brown,Brown,Green,Dark Gray,"Big Boss is a video game character from the Metal Gear video game series created by Hideo Kojima and developed and published by Konami.

He was first introduced in the 1987 Metal Gear game as the commanding officer and father of the main character, Solid Snake, later revealing himself as a terrorist leading a faction known as Outer Heaven. He is later featured in the prequel games, starting with Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater as a younger version of the character named Naked Snake (Neikiddo Sunēku), an American Special Forces Operator and decorated war hero until political manipulations cause him to be disillusioned when facing his own mentor, The Boss, and gradually develops his own private mercenary company. The original incarnation of Big Boss from the 1987 Metal Gear game is retroactively established as a separate character known as Venom Snake in Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain.

The creation of Naked Snake was made in an attempt to distance him from Solid Snake, despite both being physically similar through their characterizations. He has been voiced by Akio Ōtsuka in Japanese and David Hayter in English in these games. Critical reception to Big Boss has been positive, due to his role as a villain and rivalry formed with his former subordinate. Snake's younger persona has been praised as likeable, with critics generally enjoying the execution of his character development in the series designed to shape him into the villainous icon.

Samus Aran,Metroid,1986,Protagonist,Female,Blue,Yellow,Red,Sky Blue,"Samus Aran is a fictional character and the playable protagonist of the video game series Metroid by Nintendo. She was created by Japanese video game designer Makoto Kano. She was introduced as a player character in the original 1986 video game Metroid. Samus Aran is an ex-soldier of the Galactic Federation who became a galactic bounty hunter, usually fitted with a powered exoskeleton that is equipped with weapons such as directed-energy weapons and missiles. Throughout the series, she executes missions given to her by the Galactic Federation and the Chozo while hunting the antagonistic Space Pirates and their leader Ridley, along with the parasitic energy-draining organisms called Metroids and the manipulative cybernetic supercomputer Mother Brain.

Samus is the protagonist of several Metroid games, films, manga series, and a comic book continuation of Captain N: The Game Master. She also appears in the film Metroid: The Sky Calls, portrayed by actresses Jessica Chobot and America Young. She has featured in several other game franchises, including as a playable character in every installment of the Super Smash Bros. series.

In terms of gender representation in video games, she has received largely positive reviews. She is also recognized as one of the earliest female video game protagonists and has remained a popular and well-received character.

Metroid,Metroid,1986,Enemy,Other,None / Undefined,None / Undefined,Green,Red,"The Metroid series' eponymous bio-form, engineered by the Chozo for the sole purpose of combating the most dangerous parasitic organism in the universe, the X. As an energy leeching predator, they either hatch from eggs laid by a Queen Metroid and evolve through a complicated metamorphosis into beasts capable of untold destruction, or divide by mitosis upon exposure to Beta rays. Their durability, aggression, and Explosive Breeder tendencies make them appealing bio-weapons to a number of unsavory characters throughout the galaxy; it's suggested that a benign use may be to use them to revolutionize energy usage and consumption.

Mother Brain,Metroid,1986,Antagonist,Female,Red,None / Undefined,Red,Gray,"Mother Brain is a recurring game boss and a major antagonist in the series. The Chozo created it as a councilor, and as a means to ""accelerate their plan to link the galaxy into one unified society."" During the Space Pirate invasion of Zebes, it saw the Space Pirates as a ""perfect force capable of restoring true order to the universe,"" and successfully established itself as one of their leaders. At the same time, Mother Brain attempted to persuade Samus to be an ally in order to ""build a new age for the universe"" by claiming that because it built the power suit that Samus wears, she is indebted to Mother Brain. Mother Brain is depicted as a very large brain with cybernetic spikes and a single eye; usually contained in a glass tube which Samus must break to attack it. In Super Metroid, Mother Brain also rises from the floor with a grotesque body after her tank is destroyed. Samus seemingly destroys Mother Brain in the original Metroid, but again confronts it in Super Metroid; in this game, Samus is defeated and almost killed, but the baby Metroid intervenes, and Samus once again defeats Mother Brain. It was revealed in Metroid Prime 3 that the Galactic Federation had constructed biomechanical supercomputers called Auroras, and that there were plans for a ""Future Aurora Complex"", which appears to be the Mother Brain depicted in Super Metroid. In the first cutscene for Metroid: Other M, the scene of Mother Brain destroying the baby Metroid is reenacted in an FMV cutscene, and the main antagonist, MB, is an android housing an AI cloned from Mother Brain's genetic material from Samus' suit.

Other than Samus and the titular Metroids, Ridley is the only character that has appeared consistently throughout most of the games in the series (the exceptions being Metroid II: Return of Samus for the Game Boy, Metroid Prime 2: Echoes for the GameCube, Metroid Prime Hunters for the Nintendo DS, Metroid Prime: Federation Force for the Nintendo 3DS, and Metroid: Dread for the Nintendo Switch). He is directly responsible for the invasion of Samus' home planet, and the death of her parents, and is the franchise's primary villain, despite not typically acting as the main antagonist in an individual game.

Kraid,Metroid,1986,Antagonist,Male,Red,None / Undefined,Green,Yellow,"Kraid (Kureido) is a gigantic dinosaur-like beast and a member of the Space Pirate's High Command. His most prominent feature is his grotesquely oversized belly. First appearing in the original Metroid, he is the first part of the mini-boss duo along with Ridley. In Super Metroid he appears in his giant form, two screens tall and almost a screen wide. Metroid: Zero Mission retconned his size and appearance, showing he did not grow between games. He was also slated to appear in Metroid Prime as a boss in the Phazon Mines, with a metal dome covering his head and blue Phazon veins on his belly, but was removed due to time constraints. Kraid returns in Metroid Dread. Kraid also makes an appearance in the background of the Brinstar Depths stage in Super Smash Bros. Melee and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate where he periodically slashes and rotates the stage.

Created by Toru Iwatani, he first appeared in the arcade game Pac-Man (1980), and has since appeared in more than 30 licensed sequels and spin-offs for multiple platforms, and spawning mass amounts of merchandise in his image, including two television series and a hit single by Buckner & Garcia. He is the official mascot of Bandai Namco Entertainment. Pac-Man's most common antagonists are the Ghost Gang — Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde that are determined to defeat him to accomplish their goals, which change throughout the series. Pac-Man also has a voracious appetite, being able to consume vast amounts of food in a short timespan, and can eat his enemies by consuming large ""Power Pellets"". He also appears as a playable character in the Super Smash Bros. series and in the film Kamen Rider Heisei Generations: Dr. Pac-Man vs. Ex-Aid & Ghost with Legend Riders.

The idea of Pac-Man was taken from both the image of a pizza with a slice removed and from rounding out the Japanese symbol ""kuchi"", meaning ""mouth"". The character was made to be cute and colorful to appeal to younger players, particularly women. In Japan, he was originally titled ""Puckman"" for his hockey puck-like shape, which was changed in international releases to prevent defacement of the arcade cabinets by changing the P into an F. Pac-Man has the highest-brand awareness of any video game character in North America, becoming an icon in video games and pop culture.

She has made crossover appearances in two Mario titles to date, Mario Kart Arcade GP and its sequel, Mario Kart Arcade GP 2, along with her husband and their arch-enemy, Blinky. Her racing stats differ slightly from Pac-Man; she has better handling than him, but lower top speed (though in Mario Kart Arcade GP 2 she is a speed character). Ms. Pac-Man uses the same special items that Pac-Man does: Pooka, Rally X, and Galaga Boss, which are references to other classic Namco titles. She makes a cameo in her sprite form in the Pac-Land stage from Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.

Ghosts,Pac-Man,1981,Enemy,Other,Black,None / Undefined,Blue,Light Gray,"Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde, collectively known as the Ghost Gang, are a quartet of characters from the Pac-Man video game franchise. Created by Toru Iwatani, they first appear in the 1980 arcade game Pac-Man as the main antagonists. The ghosts have appeared in every Pac-Man game since, sometimes becoming minor antagonists or allies to Pac-Man, such as in Pac-Man World and the Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures animated series.

Some entries in the series would add other ghosts to the group, such as Sue in Ms. Pac-Man, Tim in Jr. Pac-Man, and Funky and Spunky in Pac-Mania, however these would be reverted in later games. The group has since gained a positive reception and is cited as one of the most recognizable video game villains of all time.

Pong Platform,Pong,1972,Neutral,Other,None / Undefined,None / Undefined,Gray,Light Gray,"The Pong Platform is an element of the Pong video game. Pong is a table tennis–themed twitch arcade sports video game, featuring simple two-dimensional graphics, manufactured by Atari and originally released in 1972. It was one of the earliest arcade video games; it was created by Allan Alcorn as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, but Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney were surprised by the quality of Alcorn's work and decided to manufacture the game. Bushnell based the game's concept on an electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey, the first home video game console. In response, Magnavox later sued Atari for patent infringement.

Pong was the first commercially successful video game, and it helped to establish the video game industry along with the Magnavox Odyssey. Soon after its release, several companies began producing games that closely mimicked its gameplay. Eventually, Atari's competitors released new types of video games that deviated from Pong's original format to varying degrees, and this, in turn, led Atari to encourage its staff to move beyond Pong and produce more innovative games themselves.

Atari released several sequels to Pong that built upon the original's gameplay by adding new features. During the 1975 Christmas season, Atari released a home version of Pong exclusively through Sears retail stores. The home version was also a commercial success and led to numerous clones. The game was remade on numerous home and portable platforms following its release. Pong is part of the permanent collection of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., due to its cultural impact.

Mr. Dark,Rayman,1995,Antagonist,Male,Yellow,None / Undefined,Blue,Purple,"Mr. Dark is the main antagonist of the first Rayman game and Rayman's arch-nemesis. He always wears robes and a hat and his eyes are brightly yellow. He's apparently a quite potent wizard and in the storyline he steals the great Protoon and captures the Electoons. He is the last boss of the game, although he is not battled with directly. Rayman instead fights with mixed-up versions of his minions. Rayman fights that battle in Mr. Dark's hideout, the Candy Chateau, the candy-themed world. Mr. Dark has trapped all of the Electoons in cages all around Rayman's World and Rayman has to free them all before finally reaching Mr. Dark. Eventually, Rayman catches up with the mysterious wizard, who steals his punching fist and nearly kills him with fire. However, at the crucial moment, the Electoons free Rayman and return him his fist. Mr. Dark transforms into a series of monsters whom Rayman must defeat, each one a mixture of two or three of the bosses Rayman fought previously.

Mr. Dark does not appear in Rayman Origins, but the game makes several references to him. If the player pulls the Bubble Dreamer's beard while playing as DarkRay, the Bubble Dreamer insults him, telling him to blame his ugliness on Mr. Dark; a reference to the events of the original game. At the end of the game, it is revealed that Rayman's friend, The Magician, has betrayed him in order to usurp Mr. Dark's position. Posters of Mr. Dark can be seen on the walls of The Magician's headquarters in the Moody Clouds.

Globox,Rayman,2003,Secondary,Male,Black,None / Undefined,Blue,Light Gray,"Globox is a gentle, sensitive character. Globox has some magic powers, but in times, he is only a sidekick to the main hero, Rayman. He's from a species named the glutes.

He has some family: a wife named Uglette--quite similar to him, but with pink skin--and 650 children (at the last count). One can first see Uglette on the boat near the end of Rayman 2, with a lot of their children. The children also appear in some other levels of the game, like in the prison with the huge bird robot and they appear in the bonus stage unlocked after the player found all the cages in a level. Uglette is an unlockable character in the racing game, Rayman Rush; in Rayman Arena she is replaced by Dark Globox (GameCube and Xbox only); she is the only character present in Rayman Rush who did not make it into Rayman Arena.

Globox is slightly simple, and it is said in Rayman 2 that Polokus used his sense of humor for inspiration when creating him. He's also cowardly and will flee from every enemy he sees, leaving Rayman to clear the enemies.

Globox's magic power is the ability to create a small cloud, and to make it rain. He just has to perform a rain dance. The rain is used to remove fires and destroy machinery in Rayman 2, and was apparently used by Globox to cause Robo-Pirates to rust.

In Rayman 3, Globox accidentally swallows André, ruler of the Black Lums, who also loves plum juice, so in order to quell his tantrums, he must drink it, despite the fact that Globox is allergic to plum juice... Then he behaves strangely, sometimes producing purple bubbles (which Rayman can use to get to new areas), sometimes inflating himself and flying, one time getting up a waterfall (inevitably helping Rayman get to a new area) and frequently acting out of character, behaving in a childlike, or even sometimes aggressive manner. There are three possible reasons for this, firstly because of his allergy, secondly that it has fermented, and thirdly that it may well be hallucinogenic. In this game he is voiced by actor John Leguizamo.

In the Rabbids series, there is a kid version of Globox that are greener and have wider eyes.",rayman_globox.png,banner_rayman.png,globox,rayman

Sonic the Hedgehog,Sonic,1991,Protagonist,Male,Green,None / Undefined,Blue,Red,"Sonic the Hedgehog is the protagonist of the video game series of the same name published by Sega, as well as numerous spin-off comics, animations, and other media. Sonic is an anthropomorphic blue hedgehog who can run at supersonic speeds and curl into a ball, primarily to attack enemies.

The original Sonic the Hedgehog (1991) was released to provide Sega with a mascot to rival Nintendo's flagship character Mario. Sonic was redesigned by Yuji Uekawa for Sonic Adventure (1998), with a more mature look designed to appeal to older players.

Sonic is one of the world's best-known video game characters and a gaming icon. His series had sold more than 80 million copies by 2011. In 2005, Sonic was one of the first game character inductees into the Walk of Game alongside Mario, Link, and Master Chief.

Knuckles the Echidna,Sonic,1994,Secondary,Male,Purple,None / Undefined,Red,Yellow,"Knuckles the Echidna is a red echidna and Sonic's friendly rival. First introduced in the Genesis game Sonic the Hedgehog 3, Knuckles lives on Angel Island, which hovers in the sky due to the power of the Master Emerald. As the last surviving member of the Echidna people who once inhabited the island, his duty is to guard the Master Emerald.

During conception of Sonic the Hedgehog 3, the development team wanted to create a new rival for Sonic. The final design of Knuckles was the result of dozens of possible designs inspired by numerous different animals. A character with many different abilities and skills, he is physically one of the strongest characters of the Sonic series. His strength and mastery of martial arts, specialising in punches, enables him to perform feats such as shattering boulders with his fists, while he can trap air underneath his dreadlocks in order to glide for short distances.

Fang the Sniper
Fang the Sniper, initially known as Nack the Weasel in English localizations, is a purple jerboa/wolf hybrid that first appeared in the Game Gear video game Sonic the Hedgehog: Triple Trouble in 1994. His character is a treasure hunter in search of the Chaos Emeralds; however he does not know of their true power and merely wants to sell them for his own profit. He is a slick, sneaky, and mischievous character who will steal the Emeralds for an easier job. Fang tries hard to outwit others, but is held back by his clumsiness and often fails.

Outside of Triple Trouble, Fang has had playable roles in Sonic Drift 2 and Sonic the Fighters in 1995 and 1996, and had been planned to be in the cancelled Sonic Xtreme. He has not had any significant roles since however, though he did make a cameo appearance on an in-game poster in 2011's Sonic Generations, and as an illusion during the boss fight with Heavy Magician in Sonic Mania in 2017.

Tails Prower,Sonic,1992,Secondary,Male,Blue,None / Undefined,Yellow,Light Gray,"Miles Prower better known by his nickname Tails, is a fictional character of Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog series. Tails also appears in his own spin-off series, comic books, cartoons, and films. He is the second character to consistently appear by Sonic's side in the series. The name ""Miles Prower"" is a pun on ""miles per hour"", a reference to the famed speed of Sonic the Hedgehog. He is a two-tailed fox, hence the nickname.

A mechanical genius and skilled pilot, he can fly by spinning his tails like a helicopter rotor and can be seen flying in multiple games and TV shows created by Sega. He debuted in November 1992 with the release of Sonic the Hedgehog 2. In the mid-1990s, He was featured as the main character in a number of spinoff games: Tails and the Music Maker for the Sega Pico, and Tails Adventure and Tails' Skypatrol for the Game Gear. Tails was rated the third-most-popular character in the franchise, behind Sonic and Shadow, in an official poll from Sega in 2009.

Amy Rose,Sonic,1993,Secondary,Female,Green,None / Undefined,Pink,Red,"Amy Rose is a pink hedgehog and Sonic's self-proclaimed girlfriend, who is an energetic tomboy. Amy was created by Kazuyuki Hoshino for Sonic the Hedgehog CD (1993), although she appeared Kenji Terada's Sonic the Hedgehog manga a year before. Hoshino created her in-game graphics, with many staff members contributing ideas to her design. Her headband and trainer shoes reflected Sonic CD director Naoto Ohshima's tastes, and her mannerisms reflected the traits Hoshino looked for in women at the time. Her fur color was red at first, and her skirt orange. The character had two other names in game previews: Rosy the Rascal and Princess Sally (a character in the Sonic the Hedgehog TV series and comics). Amy received her present design, with a red dress and boots, in Sonic Adventure (1998), courtesy of designer Yuji Uekawa.

In the games, Amy is depicted as driven and competitive. She spends much of her time following Sonic to get his attention or make sure he is safe while demonstrating her affection. Series co-creator Yuji Naka said that Amy was designed ""to always chase Sonic"", and has made it her life goal to one day marry him. Not possessing the speed or strength of the other characters, Amy uses a hammer to defend herself instead. In Sonic CD, Metal Sonic kidnaps Amy and Sonic must rescue her. When he does, Amy kisses him. Amy's first appearance in a Sonic platformer as a playable character was in Sonic Adventure; she is playable in Sonic Heroes (2003) and Sonic the Hedgehog (2006), and appears as a non-player character in games such as Sonic Unleashed (2008).

While some journalists have called Amy cute and powerful, others find her annoying. Justin Towell of GamesRadar+ and writers from Mean Machines expressed general displeasure at her introduction in Sonic CD. Additionally, some have criticized developers' treatment of Amy as a female character and analyzed her implications on gender representation in video games. The Electronic Gaming Monthly staff found her pink coloring and tendency to run from danger to be stereotypical and common in Japanese-created female characters, while feminist blogger Anita Sarkeesian cites Amy as an example of the ""Ms. Male Character"" trope, in which female characters in games with male protagonists often resemble those protagonists, but with stereotypically feminine features added. Despite this, Amy is one of the series' most popular characters, coming in fifth place in a Japanese popularity poll in 2006. Her likeness has been used in Sonic merchandise, and she appears in the television adaptations Sonic X (2003–2006) and Sonic Boom (2014–2017).

Dr. Eggman,Sonic,1991,Antagonist,Male,Blue,None / Undefined,Red,Yellow,"Doctor Ivo ""Eggman"" Robotnik is the main antagonist of Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog series. Eggman was created and designed by Naoto Ohshima as part of many design choices for Sega's new mascot. After the creation of Sonic the Hedgehog, Ohshima chose to use his previous egg-shaped character to create the antagonist of the 1991 video game Sonic the Hedgehog, making him the arch-nemesis of the series' eponymous main character.

In the main line of video games, Dr. Eggman is a mad scientist who plans to conquer the world to build his own empire. While he has gone through several major and minor appearance changes throughout the series, his in-game designs retain several basic characteristics, such as his ovate body, red-black-yellow clothing, bald head, a onesie, pince-nez sunglasses, and large mustache. Eggman commonly creates machines and robots, including a wide variety of Badniks. Notably in early games, he has also served as a recurring boss, appearing in almost every level piloting one of his created vehicles.

Eggman has appeared in almost every Sonic the Hedgehog video game since his first appearance in the 1991 title Sonic the Hedgehog and is also a prominent character in other media, including comics, novels, and cartoons. He made his live-action cinematic debut in the 2020 film adaptation, portrayed by Jim Carrey. Eggman has been well received by critics and is one of the most popular and recognizable villains in gaming history.

Shadow the Hedgehog,Sonic,2001,Neutral,Male,Red,None / Undefined,Dark Gray,Red,"Shadow the Hedgehog is an artificially created life form in the design of a black and red male hedgehog, similar to Sonic. His trademark hover skates propel him at extreme speeds that rival those of Sonic.

According to official profiles, Shadow was created 50 years ago by Professor Gerald Robotnik as the ""Ultimate Life Form"", which is ageless and immortal. Sharp witted and seemingly always on the edge, once he has set himself to a goal, he will do whatever it takes to accomplish it, regardless of any danger. After the trauma of the death of his only friend, Maria Robotnik, Shadow strives to fulfill his purpose and keep the promise he made to her. Although his relationship with Sonic seems to have developed from antagonistic to friendly rivalry, animosity from not understanding their different mindsets still occurs.

However, Shadow shares a lot of similarities with Sonic. He can perform spin attacks common to Sonic, which are a variation on the tendency for hedgehogs to roll into tight balls for protection. Additionally, with the power of a Chaos Emerald, Shadow can warp time and space with Chaos Control. Shadow is also able to use a variety of other Chaos powers, such as ""Chaos Spear"" and ""Chaos Blast"".

Using the power of the seven Chaos Emeralds, Shadow uses his super transformation to transform into Super Shadow and bestows new abilities of flight and near invulnerability, with normal abilities of speed and enhanced Chaos powers.

Silver the Hedgehog,Sonic,2006,Secondary,Male,Yellow,None / Undefined,Yellow,Light Gray,"Silver the Hedgehog is a silver-furred hedgehog from 200 years in the future of the main timeline. He first appeared in the 2006 Sonic the Hedgehog. His individual episode revolves around him traveling back in time with Blaze the Cat to find and slay Sonic the Hedgehog, who they believe is the cause of their world being destroyed in the future. Silver's primary ability is telekinesis; he is able to levitate objects and use them as projectiles to either defeat enemies, or interact with his environment. Like Sonic and Shadow, he transforms into his ""super form"" by using the power of the seven Chaos Emeralds.

Silver's creation was inspired by the game's early development stages, where the development team was making huge levels with multiple paths through them, and decided they wanted to include a new character with unique abilities for an alternate way to play through the levels. The design team developed over fifty different concepts for the character. At one point he was to actually be an orange mink named Venice (named after the city of the same name), but the developers ultimately decided against this, fearing a mink would not blend in with the rest of the characters. They ended up deciding to make another hedgehog instead. Orange was originally decided for his fur, but they soon moved away from that in color, in favor to a white-gray one. While developing the character models and textures, they focused on using the hardware to develop the textures rather than just use white-gray, which lead to Silver's color and name. Additionally, Silver's backstory was inspired by Trunks from the 1984 - 1995 manga Dragon Ball, who made a similar journey to the past to kill two androids that would eradicate most of humanity in his own time; the script for Sonic the Hedgehog (2006) flat-out states ""Essentially, think Trunks from Dragon Ball Z.""

Since his first appearance in Sonic the Hedgehog (2006), he has mainly appeared in the Sonic series' spinoffs, multiplayer games, and small cameo roles. He is one of the playable characters in Sonic Rivals and Sonic Rivals 2, a playable character strictly in the multiplayer modes in Sonic and the Secret Rings and Sonic and the Black Knight, a playable racer in Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity, Sonic Free Riders and Team Sonic Racing, and a playable athlete in the Mario & Sonic series beginning with Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games. He appears in Sonic Generations as a boss in the stages Crisis City (console version) and Tropical Resort (3DS version). Additionally, Silver was one of a few Sega characters to make a cameo in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, in the background of Sonic's Green Hill Zone stage, and as a trophy and sticker.

The character has generally not been very well-received by critics.",sonic_silver.png,banner_sonic.png,silver,sonic
Vector the Crocodile,Sonic,1995,Enemy,Male,Yellow,None / Undefined,Green,Yellow,"Vector the Crocodile is a crocodile who is the ""head honcho"" and brains of the Chaotix Detective Agency. Divided between being ""bossy"" and ""easy-going"", his rough speech and outward appearance mask his clear reasoning and ability to resolve cases. For the right price he will take on most jobs, unless they involve doing something immoral. Vector has a strong sense of justice and kindness, despite his argumentativeness. He often does unpaid work due to his charitable nature, leaving the agency constantly short on money. Vector hates having to work for the landlord, but he enjoys singing, and his trademark is a set of headphones. He is physically very strong and his powerful jaws are a formidable weapon.

Vector was originally supposed to be in the sound test of the first Sonic the Hedgehog game, but he, along with the feature itself, was removed prior to release. He was part of Team Chaotix in Sonic Heroes and is featured in Shadow the Hedgehog, Sonic Generations, Sonic Forces and more (alongside both Espio and Charmy in said games). In all installments of Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games, he is a playable athlete. He is playable in other spinoff titles such as Sonic Free Riders and Team Sonic Racing.

Metal Sonic,Sonic,1993,Enemy,Other,Red,None / Undefined,Blue,Red,"Metal Sonic is an evil robotic version of Sonic created by Dr. Robotnik. He first appears in Sonic the Hedgehog CD. He is given orders to go back in time and change the past so that Dr. Eggman can rule the future. Sonic must race him in Stardust Speedway to free Amy Rose. He is severely wounded when he crashes and falls, but is rejuvenated by Robotnik in Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode II, only to be defeated again in a similar style. He returns in Knuckles' Chaotix, where he attempts to obtain the Chaos Rings, but he is stopped by the Chaotix. Metal Sonic notably acted as the main antagonist in Sonic Heroes, appearing in a new form as Neo Metal Sonic before transforming into the game's final boss, the Metal Overlord. Upon being defeated by Super Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles, he reverts to his traditional appearance. He appears as the main antagonist in the Sonic the Hedgehog (OVA), where Eggman records Sonic's abilities and uploads them to Metal Sonic, who proceeds in attempting to destroy the world before being tossed into lava by Sonic. Metal Sonic appears as a bonus playable character in Sonic Rivals, reprogrammed to aid Eggman Nega in his attempt to take over the world. He returns as a playable character in Sonic Rivals 2, under orders from Eggman to aid Shadow in stopping Eggman Nega's plans. In Sonic Free Riders, Metal Sonic is a playable character and the final opponent in the game's story mode. In Sonic Generations, he appears in his classic form as a rival boss, battling Classic Sonic in Stardust Speedway before ultimately being destroyed. Metal Sonic returns as a boss character in Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric and Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystal. He appears in the Sonic Boom episode, ""It Wasn't Me, It Was the One-Armed Hedgehog"". Metal Sonic appears as a boss in the Sonic story mode of Lego Dimensions.

Metal Sonic appeared as a playable character in the multiplayer mode of Sonic Adventure 2: Battle, as well as Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, and all the Mario & Sonic titles beginning with Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games. Collecting all the emblems in Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut unlocks Metal Sonic as a bonus playable character in Sonic's stages, and purchasing both episodes of Sonic the Hedgehog 4 unlocks bonus levels in which Metal Sonic is playable.

He possesses great strength, including a laser cannon, a jet engine and a force field device he can use to protect himself from projectiles and certain attacks. He usually only communicates with a series of electronic noises. The only notable time Metal Sonic was able to talk was in Sonic Heroes in which he was voiced by Jun'ichi Kanemaru in Japanese and Ryan Drummond in English.

GameDaily placed Metal Sonic 13th on their ""Top 25 Video Game Robots"" list, describing him as Dr. Robotnik's ""greatest creation"" and praising the strength of his abilities.

Mario,Super Mario,1981,Protagonist,Male,Blue,Brown,Red,Blue,"Mario is a character created by Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto. He is the title character of the Mario franchise and the mascot of Japanese video game company Nintendo. Mario has appeared in over 200 video games since his creation. Depicted as a short, pudgy, Italian plumber who resides in the Mushroom Kingdom, his adventures generally center on rescuing Princess Peach from the Koopa villain Bowser. Mario has access to a variety of power-ups that give him different abilities. Mario's fraternal twin brother is Luigi.

Mario first appeared as the player character of Donkey Kong (1981), a platform game. Miyamoto wanted to use Popeye as the protagonist, but when he could not achieve the licensing rights, he created Mario instead. Miyamoto expected the character to be unpopular and planned to use him for cameo appearances; originally called ""Mr. Video"", he was renamed to Mario after Mario Segale. Mario's clothing and characteristics were themed after the setting of Donkey Kong. He then began to star in the Super Mario series of platform games, beginning with the critically acclaimed Super Mario Bros. in 1985. Since 1992, Mario has been voiced by Charles Martinet.

After Super Mario Bros., Mario began to branch off to different genres. These include puzzle games such as Dr. Mario, role-playing games such as Paper Mario and Mario & Luigi, and sports games such as Mario Kart and Mario Tennis. He has appeared in other Nintendo properties, such as in the Super Smash Bros. series of crossover fighting games. Mario has also appeared in various animations, including three series produced by DIC Entertainment (voiced by Lou Albano and later Walker Boone), and was portrayed by Bob Hoskins in the 1993 Super Mario Bros. film. He will be voiced by Chris Pratt in the upcoming 2023 film adaptation.

Mario is near-unanimously considered to be the most famous character in the video game industry and an established pop culture icon. Mario's likeness has appeared in a variety of merchandise, such as clothing and collectible items, and people and places have been nicknamed after him. He has also inspired a considerable amount of unofficial media. With more than 750 million units sold worldwide, the overall Mario franchise is the bestselling video game franchise of all time.",super_mario_mario.png,banner_super_mario.png,mario,super mario
Luigi,Super Mario,1983,Secondary,Male,Blue,Brown,Green,Blue,"Luigi is a fictional character featured in video games and related media released by Nintendo. Created by Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto, Luigi is portrayed as the younger fraternal twin brother and sidekick of Mario, Nintendo's mascot. Luigi appears in many games throughout the Mario franchise, oftentimes accompanying his brother. Luigi first appeared in the 1983 Game & Watch game Mario Bros., where he is the character controlled by the second player. He would retain this role in many future games, including Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario World, among other titles. He was first available as a primary character in Super Mario Bros. 2. In more recent appearances, Luigi's role became increasingly restricted to spinoffs, such as the Mario Party and Mario Kart series; however, he has been featured in a starring role in Luigi's Hammer Toss, Mario is Missing, Luigi's Mansion, Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon, Dr. Luigi, New Super Luigi U, Luigi's Mansion Arcade, and Luigi's Mansion 3. In most of said games, he is called upon to act as the hero because Mario is in need of rescue. Luigi has also appeared in every episode of the three DiC TV series based on the NES and Super NES games.
Originally developed as a palette swap of Mario with a green color scheme instead of red, Luigi has since developed a personality and style of his own. As his role in the Mario series progressed, Luigi evolved into a physically distinct character, and was made taller and thinner than his brother. Nintendo called the period of March 2013 to March 2014 the Year of Luigi to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the character's existence. Correspondingly, games released in 2013 emphasized Luigi. An unlockable Luigi-themed version of Mario Bros., titled Luigi Bros., was also included with Super Mario 3D World.",super_mario_luigi.png,banner_super_mario.png,luigi,super mario
Wario,Super Mario,1992,Neutral,Male,Blue,Brown,Yellow,Purple,"Wario is a fictional character and antagonist in Nintendo's Mario series, designed as an arch-rival to Mario. He first appeared in the 1992 Game Boy game Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins as the main antagonist and final boss. His name is a portmanteau of Mario's name and the Japanese word warui, meaning ""bad"". Wario was designed by Hiroji Kiyotake, and is voiced by Charles Martinet, who voices many other characters in the series, including Mario, Luigi, and Waluigi.

Wario has become the protagonist and antihero of the Wario Land and WarioWare series, spanning handheld and console markets. In addition to appearances in spin-offs in the Mario series, he has appeared in other Nintendo properties, such as in the Super Smash Bros. series of crossover fighting games. He has also been featured in other media such as the Super Mario Adventures graphic novel. The character has received a largely positive critical reception.

Peach,Super Mario,1985,Secondary,Female,Blue,Yellow,Pink,Yellow,"Princess Peach (casually Peach, usually known as Princess Toadstool outside of Japan prior to Super Mario 64) is a main character in the Mario franchise and the princess of the Mushroom Kingdom. Peach first appeared in Super Mario Bros. and was created by Shigeru Miyamoto to be the damsel-in-distress throughout most Mario games. She resides in her castle along with many Toads, who act as her loyal servants. Her kingdom is often attacked by the Koopa Troop, a group led by Bowser. She is the love interest of Mario.

Peach has an affinity for the color pink, which accents her gentle personality and kind temperament. Peach's gentle nature and role as the damsel in distress are often represented with her heart abilities and crown emblem. Peach's initial design was said to represent her stubborn yet cute appearance.[4][dead link]

Since her debut, Peach has appeared in installments related to the Mario game series for over three decades. She has appeared in more games than any other female character in video game history. Peach is occasionally a supporting character in mainstream games and almost always playable in spin-off installments. Her most prominent appearance to date is as the heroine of Super Princess Peach and the most recent mainstream game where she appears as a playable character rather than a damsel-in-distress is Super Mario 3D World.

Waluigi,Super Mario,2000,Neutral,Male,Gray,Black,Purple,Blue,"Waluigi is Luigi's lanky rival and Wario's partner. Waluigi made his debut in Mario Tennis, and since then, he has made playable appearances exclusively in the Mario franchise's spin-off titles. He makes an appearance as a playable character in all but one game in the Mario Tennis series. He has been voiced by Charles Martinet ever since his debut. His name is a portmanteau of the Japanese words warui, meaning ""bad"", and Ruīji, meaning ""Luigi"".

Waluigi is defined by his purple attire, nasally Italian accent, long handlebar-esque mustache (and other bizarre physical features), rude and trickster personality, rivalry with Luigi, and tendency to cheat.

Bowser,Super Mario,1985,Antagonist,Male,Red,Red,Yellow,Green,"Bowser, sometimes known as King Koopa or King Bowser (Japanese: Daimaō Kuppa, which translates into ""Great Demon King Koopa"" or ""Great Sorcerer King Koopa,"" the latter being used in the manual of Super Mario Bros.) and more recently referred to by his minions as Lord Bowser or Master Bowser (Japanese: Kuppa-sama), is a major character and the main antagonist of the Mario franchise. He is a large, powerful, fire-breathing Koopa who leads the Koopa Troop, an antagonistic organization of turtle-like creatures, and has been the arch-nemesis of Mario since his debut in Super Mario Bros. He has repeatedly kidnapped or attempted to kidnap Princess Peach with the ultimate goal of defeating Mario and taking over the Mushroom Kingdom. Bowser's defining traits are his monstrous appearance with dragon-like elements, full-throated roar, fire-breathing abilities, cruel personality, bestial reptilian voice, never-ending conflict with Mario, and unrequited crush for Peach.

While Bowser is generally referred to as ""Koopa"" in Japanese, there are occasions where his localized name is alluded to. For example, in the Japanese version of Mario Kart Wii, the Flame Runner is known as the Super Bowser. Because all regional releases of Super Mario Sunshine use the English voice acting, Peach calls Bowser Jr. ""Bowser's son,"" and Bowser himself calls his family the ""royal Koopa line,"" meaning that Koopa is also his surname in the Japanese language. Bowser Koopa is rarely directly given as his full name, but it has occurred in some officially licensed material such as the White Knuckle Scorin' album comic, as well as certain cartoon episodes and comic issues.

Yoshi,Super Mario,1990,Secondary,Other,Blue,None / Undefined,Green,Red,"Yoshi is a dinosaur-like character that acts as an ally of Mario and Luigi and is the protagonist of his own franchise. Among members of the Yoshi species hailing from Yoshi's Island, any Yoshi may be identified as the ""Yoshi"" character, and as such, not all iterations of the character are necessarily the same one. According to the Super Mario World manual, he got his name from Yoshi's Island because he was first discovered there. In the Super Mario series, he often acts as a rideable character for the heroes, while in most of the spin-off games, he is a playable character on his own. Yoshi's defining traits include his cutesy appearance, his cheerful and friendly personality, his flutter-jumping and egg-laying abilities, his rideability as a steed, and exclaiming his own name.

Goomba,Super Mario,1985,Enemy,Other,Black,None / Undefined,Brown,Light Gray,"Goombas, initially called Little Goombas, are one of the major species of the Mario franchise. Since their first game appearance in Super Mario Bros., they have become one of the most iconic members of the Koopa Troop and the entire Mario franchise, appearing in almost every title. Goombas resemble small brown mushrooms and are a fungus-based species like Toads, Amanitas, Spooks, and Shroobs. Goombas are physically weak and are not much of a threat to Mario or Luigi, since a single stomp usually defeats them, although a number of different Goomba variants have emerged throughout the years; however, they do drop hints of being much stronger and more competent than their appearances suggest, as in the case of Captain Goomba. The Goombas, as a collective race, used to be allied with the Mushroom Kingdom. However, most of the Goombas have turned traitorous and joined the Koopa Troop, an organization led by Bowser. In many games, Goombas are the first enemy the player meets. Goombas have two feet and no visible arms or legs. Since Super Mario RPG, however, not all Goombas are allied with Bowser or the Koopa Troop. Some Goombas, such as the inhabitants of Goomba Village, live peacefully inside the borders of the Mushroom Kingdom, while others simply hold no allegiance and operate independently in distant locales such as Monstro Town and Rogueport.

Goombas, along with Koopa Troopas, are Mario's most common enemies.

Toad,Super Mario,1985,Secondary,Male,Black,None / Undefined,Red,Light Gray,"Toad is one of the main characters of the Mario franchise. He is Princess Peach's attendant and a longtime protector of the Mushroom Kingdom. He is actually a singular character among an entire species of look-alikes (much like Yoshi is to the Yoshi species), leading to confusion over some of his appearances. He usually has the role of a supporting character who tries to help Mario and Luigi on their adventures, although he occasionally has been a main protagonist, such as in Super Mario Bros. 2, Super Mario 3D World, and his starring roles in Wario's Woods and Kinopio Live. His role as Peach's steward has sometimes instead been given to Toadsworth.

Toad also appears regularly as a playable character in the Mario spin-offs. Since Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, Toad's partner in spin-offs has been Toadette. Toad's defining traits are his cartoonish and cutesy appearance, his optimism and humble, his sometimes cowardly personality, and his characteristic smile and voice.

Link,The Legend of Zelda,1986,Protagonist,Male,Blue,Yellow,Green,Sky Blue,"Link is a fictional character and the protagonist of Nintendo's video game series The Legend of Zelda. He is one of Nintendo's most iconic characters. He was created by Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto. Link was introduced as the hero of the original 1986 The Legend of Zelda video game and has appeared in a total of 19 entries in the series, as well as a number of spin-offs. Common elements in the series include Link travelling through Hyrule whilst exploring dungeons, battling creatures and solving puzzles until he eventually defeats the series' primary antagonist, Ganon, and saves Princess Zelda.

Throughout The Legend of Zelda series, Link has made multiple appearances in a variety of incarnations. He has been rendered in both 2D and 3D form and has been traditionally depicted in his signature green cap and tunic carrying a sword and shield. Over the course of the series, he appears as a child or young adult of the Hylian race, which originates from the fictional kingdom of Hyrule. Within Zelda lore, Link is the soul of a legendary hero that throughout history is reincarnated within a seemingly ordinary boy or man when the need arises for a new warrior to defeat the forces of evil. To defeat Ganon, Link usually obtains the mystical Master Sword or a similar legendary weapon, which is obtained after completing various trials. Over the course of his journey, he also acquires other magical items, including musical instruments and other weaponry.

In addition to the main series, Link has appeared in other Nintendo media, including merchandise, comics and manga, and an animated television series. He is a prominent character in various spin-off games, including Hyrule Warriors, Cadence of Hyrule and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity.

Zelda,The Legend of Zelda,1986,Protagonist,Female,Blue,Yellow,Pink,Light Gray,"Princess Zelda is the titular character in Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda video game series. She was created by Shigeru Miyamoto and introduced in the original 1986 game The Legend of Zelda. She is one of the central characters in the series, having appeared in multiple incarnations over more than three decades. In the fictional storyline of the series, she is a princess of the kingdom of Hyrule, an associate of the protagonist Link, and bearer of the Triforce of Wisdom.

Though she is the eponymous character, Zelda's story role is often that of a damsel in distress or donor who assists Link. In many games, Zelda is captured by the antagonist Ganon, necessitating Link to come to her rescue. In several games she is one of the Sages or Champions whose heroism is essential to defeating Ganon; in others, like Ocarina of Time and The Wind Waker, she adopts alternative personas to take a more active role in the story. In Skyward Sword, she is established as the mortal reincarnation of the goddess Hylia, which gives her incarnations a range of magical powers.

Zelda is a widely recognisable character in video gaming and a popular character with gamers and cosplayers. In addition to The Legend of Zelda series, she has appeared as a playable character in a number of spin-off games and other game series, including Hyrule Warriors, Cadence of Hyrule and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity. She also appears as a playable character in the Super Smash Bros. series. Critics have responded positively to her character development and have listed her as one of the greatest female video game characters of all time.

Ganondorf,The Legend of Zelda,1986,Antagonist,Male,Yellow,Red,Dark Gray,Red,"Ganon (known as Ganondorf Dragmire in his Gerudo form) is the series' main villain and most recurring final boss.

In the games, Ganondorf is the leader of the desert-dwelling Gerudo race and Link's evil archenemy. His specific motives vary from game to game, but most often include kidnapping Princess Zelda and seeking the Triforce.

In many games, he already possesses or acquires a portion of the Triforce called the Triforce of Power, leading him to seek the Triforce of Wisdom and the Triforce of Courage, held by Zelda and Link respectively. In Ocarina of Time, he uses the child Link, who has possession of the Master Sword, to grab the Triforce. Since Ganondorf's heart is only in balance to the Triforce of Power, it breaks in three - Power given to Ganondorf, Courage given to Link (who was in a seven-year unconscious state at the time), and Wisdom to Zelda (who has gone into hiding as Sheik). In order to possess all three, Ganon must vanquish the other two.

Unlike most other characters, Ganon is the same version of his character in every game with the exception of Four Swords Adventures where he is Ganon's reincarnation. He is also the physical personification of the Demon King Demise's hatred and is destined to reincarnate eternally if he is killed.",the_legend_of_zelda_ganondorf.png,banner_the_legend_of_zelda.png,ganondorf,the legend of zelda
Old Man,The Legend of Zelda,1986,Secondary,Male,Brown,White,Red,Light Gray,"The Old Man is a character in multiple titles in the series, notably the original Legend of Zelda. He is a bald man with a red robe and white beard. Link can usually find him inside dungeons or caves standing between two torches. The Old Man has several functions, commonly giving Link items or advice. He is known for his vague advice, such as ""DODONGO DISLIKES SMOKE"", some of which was corrected in later releases of the game. He appears later in The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons (2001). In The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (2017), Link encounters an old man early in the game who is later revealed to be the deceased King of Hyrule, King Rhoam Bosphoramus Hyrule.

IGN ranked him number five on its list of the Top 20 Weirdest Zelda Characters. His expression, ""IT'S DANGEROUS TO GO ALONE! TAKE THIS"" from The Legend of Zelda is a popular Internet meme that has been included in a list of the most repeated video games quotes compiled by GamesRadar.

Impa,The Legend of Zelda,1998,Secondary,Female,Brown,White,Red,Light Gray,"Impa is a caretaker to Princess Zelda. There are many incarnations of the character named Impa throughout the Zelda series, all being from the head family of the Sheikah Tribe, just as there are multiple incarnations of Link and Zelda. As with Link and Zelda, all incarnations of Impa share certain personality traits.

The original Impa (appearing in The Legend of Zelda and The Adventure of Link instruction manuals, but not in the actual games) is portrayed as an old woman who calls for Link to save Zelda from Ganon and his henchmen. The Impa from The Legend of Zelda also inspired a separate incarnation of her who appears in the Philips spin-off Zelda: Wand of Gamelon. In the game, she assists Zelda on her quest by giving her tips provided by the Triforce of Wisdom. Eve Karpf voices Impa in Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon.

The Impa of Ocarina of Time is a Sheikah who is both Zelda's bodyguard and a descendant of the tribe that founded Kakariko Village. After Link talks with Princess Zelda, Impa appears and teaches him ""Zelda's Lullaby"" and helps him get out of Hyrule Castle. When Ganondorf attacks Hyrule Castle Town, Impa helps Princess Zelda escape on a white horse. It is later revealed that she is in fact the Sage of Shadow, one of the Six Sages who were led by Princess Zelda herself.

An overweight version of Impa is a main character in Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages. In the latter she is briefly possessed by Veran.

In Twilight Princess, a character named Impaz dwells in a village with a sign in Hylian text which reads ""Old Kakarico"" [sic], and claims that she is serving both the Royal Family and that she was named after the founder of the village. She is also of the Impa family.

In Skyward Sword, Impa is a Sheikah under Hylia assigned to protect Zelda during her time on the surface. Impa appears as both a young time traveler who eventually returns to her time and as the elderly overseer of the Sealed Grounds who eventually passes away once her purpose is fulfilled. This incarnation of Impa is seemingly harsher towards others as shown during the first portion of the story. Even though she knows Link is Hylia's chosen warrior, Impa initially believes him to be incompetent and chastises his inability to protect Zelda. She does become less harsh in her old age.

In The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds, Lady Impa is once again Zelda's nursemaid, and her lineage from one of the Six Sages is well-known. She is eventually captured by Yuga and is used alongside the other Sages and Princess Zelda to release Ganon. Once Link frees her from the Turtle Rock dungeon, she is sent to the Spirit World to assist him when all Sages are brought together and presents him with the Triforce of Courage.

Impa appears as a playable character in Hyrule Warriors, with her design and role being a hybrid of her Ocarina of Time and Skyward Sword incarnations. This version of Impa functions as a general in the Hyrulean army, capable of wielding a giant sword or a naginata. Unlike the Ocarina of Time version, Impa is initially oblivious of Sheik's identity which causes her to be distrustful of the ninja. It is only after the defeat of the false Zelda in the Water Temple in the Era of the Hero of Time, that Impa learns Sheik's identity.

In Breath of the Wild, she is the elder of Kakariko Village, the Sheikah People's village, and was the former advisor to Hyrule's royal family. She guides Link on his journey and relates some events of the Great Calamity. She is the first incarnation of Impa shown to have family relatives. She is 120 years old, and has a 124 year old sister, Purah, who appears six years old due to a mishap involving a rune when she attempted to make herself younger, and a granddaughter, Paya, who harbors a secret crush on Link. A younger version of Impa appears as a playable character in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity. As a young adult, she looks nearly identical to Paya, though unlike her granddaughter, she has a blue Sheikah symbol on her forehead instead of red.

Agahnim,The Legend of Zelda,1991,Antagonist,Male,Yellow,Red,Red,Purple,"Agahnim is an evil wizard who is a major villain in The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. Appearing during a period of flood, famine, and disease, Agahnim assisted the Royal Family by dispelling multiple plagues and became their trusted advisor for a time. However, he soon displayed his true colors and seized power for himself by killing the King of Hyrule and brainwashing the castle soldiers. Agahnim begins capturing the descendants of the Seven Sages and banishes them to the Dark World to release Ganon from his imprisonment. Link is unable to stop Agahnim from capturing Princess Zelda, but he is able to defeat Agahnim by using the Master Sword to reflect the wizard's magic onto himself.

As a last act of defiance, Agahnim escapes to the Dark World and drags Link with him, beginning the second half of the game's plot. Near the end of the game, Agahnim meets Link again on top of Ganon's Tower and is finally slain after another battle, where it is revealed that his body is a vessel for Ganon's soul.

In Link's Awakening, Agahnim's Shadow was one of the Shadows of Link's former foes who attacked Link in the final battle in Koholint Island's Wind Fish Egg.

Lara Croft,Tomb Raider,1996,Protagonist,Female,Brown,Brown,Brown,Sky Blue,"Lara Croft is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the video game franchise Tomb Raider. She is presented as a highly intelligent and athletic British archaeologist who ventures into ancient tombs and hazardous ruins around the world. Created by a team at British developer Core Design that included Toby Gard, the character first appeared in the video game Tomb Raider in 1996.

Core Design handled the initial development of the character and the series. Inspired by strong female icons, Gard designed Lara Croft to counter stereotypical female characters. The company modified the character for subsequent titles, which included graphical improvements and gameplay additions. American developer Crystal Dynamics took over the series after the 2003 sequel Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness was received poorly. The new developer rebooted the character along with the video game series by altering her physical proportions and giving her additional ways of interacting with game environments. Croft has been voiced by six actresses in the video game series: Shelley Blond (1996), Judith Gibbins (1997–98), Jonell Elliott (1999–2003), Keeley Hawes (2006–14), Camilla Luddington (2013–present), and Abigail Stahlschmidt (2015).

Lara Croft has further appeared in video game spin-offs, printed adaptations, a series of animated short films, feature films, and merchandise related to the series. The promotion of the character includes a brand of apparel and accessories, action figures, and model portrayals. She has been licensed for third-party promotion, including television and print advertisements, music-related appearances, and as a spokesmodel.

Critics consider Lara Croft a significant game character in popular culture. She holds six Guinness World Records, has a strong fan following, and is among the first video game characters to be successfully adapted to film. Lara Croft is also considered a sex symbol, one of the earliest in the industry to achieve widespread attention. The character's influence in the industry has been a point of contention among critics; viewpoints range from a positive agent of change in video games to a negative role model for young girls.

Jacqueline Natla,Tomb Raider,1996,Antagonist,Female,Blue,Yellow,Sky Blue,Dark Gray,"Jacqueline Natla is one of the main antagonists in the Tomb Raider franchise. Despite not appearing in every game, she has appeared in Tomb Raider and Tomb Raider: Underworld. Despite her human form, Natla is in fact a sort of demon who used to be one of the 3 Gods who ruled the mystical underwater city of Atlantis. The three Gods created the Scion, a powerful artifact that Natla tried to use to create a super race of Atlanteans before being cast away due to her abusing her powers. She was later set free from her mystical prison after US bomb testing in New Mexico accidentally released her.

After she was released, she founded Nalta Technologies, a massive firm that specializes in computers and top secret research. She used said company to try and find the Scion, even hiring Lara Croft at one point, but before she could eliminate her, she was foiled by Croft.

Larson Conway,Tomb Raider,1996,Enemy,Male,Gray,Brown,Gray,Red,"Larson Conway is a character making his appearances in the original Tomb Raider, the remake Tomb Raider Anniversary and Tomb Raider Chronicles. He did not have a surname in Tomb Raider and Tomb Raider Chronicles, this was given to him for Tomb Raider Anniversary.

The name Larson, coupled with the character's blond hair, suggests Scandinavian heritage, although Larson himself speaks with a Texan accent. He is portrayed as being something of a halfwit, which Pierre attributes to the fact that Larson was ""kicked in the head by a horse"" at some point in his life.",tomb_raider_larson_conway.png,banner_tomb_raider.png,larson conway,tomb raider
